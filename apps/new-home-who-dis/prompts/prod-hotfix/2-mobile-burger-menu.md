Looks like we've got another hotfix on our hands. The mobile view of the header is broken and I want us to implement a hotfix that we're going to send in the `main` branch.

Make the burger menu occupy the whole screen when it is open and split the screen vertically in equal sections such that all nav links fill the whole screen on the vertical axis.
